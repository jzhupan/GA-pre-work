    <p>Hi! I'm Jennie, I graduated with a BFA title in Communication Design, with a focus on illustration.</p>
    <p>
    I took a web design course back in college, however, it has been quite some time ever since. I am now ready to <s>cry</s>, I mean, I'm ready to learn how to code properly. It's a pleasure meeting you all, I hope we can get along during our bootcamp. Feel free to send me a message, please enter your email below.

    <i>Note that this is a mock-up, the submit button won't work.
    JS wasn't implemented during the making of this. 
    Also the reason I placed a logo at the top is because I didn't want my face to be displayed in the embedded url. Thank you.</i>
